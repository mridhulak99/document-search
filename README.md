# Document-Search
Creates a faster search engine for a particular text. The data is first cleaned and parsed using NLP techniques and loaded into a trie data structure file system. This contains the documents that contain the particular word in the tire data structure. 

Based upon user queries the document will retrieve the data and display the same to the user. This was implemented as a part of Information retrieval project.
